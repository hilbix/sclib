THIS IS MORE A CONCEPTUAL PAPER.  BUT READ ON!
AS THERE ARE NO MORE FUTURE RELEASES OF S&C THIS IS ALL YOU HAVE.

I don't need a restore capability, as I only back up files for web
servers or dumps of databases, where the raw data is all you need.
And there will be a successor to S&C, however this will take quite a
time.  For more about why S&C, read the file RATIONALE.


Assumptions:

dial-up.provider.at.eu is your location in Europe.
this.computer.is.ko.us is the computer located in America.
scylla-charybdis.ok.au is the backup server located in Australia.
You don't want to fly to America nor Australia to get the backup
done.  All you have are some "remote hands" at both locations.

Prerequisites:

1) You have an internet connection
1a) All computers have an Internet connection.
1b) this.computer.is.ko.us can reach scylla-charybdis.ok.au via Internet.
1c) There is no firewall blocking the port where scylla listens on.

2) All computers work properly
2a) this.computer.is.ko.us is running and must be backed up.
2b) scylla-charybdis.ok.au has scylla installed as an inetd service.
2c) Scylla listens on the port 999 (change this accordingly).
2d) Only one instance of the backup script runs in parallel.

3) You have all tools in place
3a) this.computer.is.ko.us has charybdis installed in /usr/local/bin/
3b) The S&C distribution with all files lies at /home/src/sc/
3c) scylla-charybdis.ok.au has scylla installed in /usr/local/sbin/
3d) You have a scylla.pem to make SSL work
3e) You know how to use your brain

Process description for the lazy admin:

On scylla-charybdis.ok.au install scylla as an inetd service (as root):

/home/src/sc/example/make-ssl-certificate
ln -s /some/big/filesystem /scylla
chown nobody /scylla/.
chmod 1777 /scylla/.
echo "999 stream tcp nowait nobody /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/local/sbin/scylla /scylla password /etc/scylla.pem" >> /etc/inetd.conf
killall -1 inetd


From dial-up.provider.at.eu open a shell to this.computer.is.ko.us
Run screen and within screen do a su to root.
Create a fresh directory not under /tmp and change into it. Run:
echo password |
/home/src/sc/example/backuploop.sh scylla-charybdis.ok.au:999 /


Be sure

- to replace password above by a real password.

- to use an absalute path (starting with /) at the second argument.

- that /bin/bash exists to run the script.

- to echo the correct Password.  The script only waits 1 second
  to read the input from STDIN and then displays the Usage.

- netcat is installed.  If you don't want netcat,
  UNCOMMENT the return 0 within the script.

- there is enough free room in /tmp .

- not to run two instances of backuploop.sh in parallel.

Note that backuploop allows you to give some parameters to it:

- You can give more than one path argument to the script

- You can give throttle information parameter in the form
  host:port@throttle:blocksize
  Throtteling means, roughly transfer only throttle KB/s with
  packets of a given blocksize (:blocksize can be left away)

- If you interrupt the script, you can (nearly) restart it where it
  broke by specifying the working-timestamp.  This looks like:
	/tmp/scylla.backup/YYYYMMDDhhmmss
	`hostname -f`/tmp/scylla.backup/YYYYMMDDhhmmss
	YYYYMMDDhhmmss
  BE SURE ALL IS SYNCED ON scylla-charybdis.ok.au!

- If you want to speed things up (weird) by running several charybdis
  in parallel, try following helper (this is thought for LANs only):
  Be sure you have compiled /home/src/sc/example/read-nonblocking.c
  like this: cd /home/src/sc/example && make read-nonblocking
  echo password |
  /home/src/sc/example/backuploophelper.sh scylla-charybdis.ok.au:999 /tmp/scylla.backup/YYYYMMDDhhmmss.tmp X
  where YYYYMMDDhhmmss.tmp is the (existing) timestamp working
  directory and X is a number from 1 to "number of lines of your
  terminal less 1".
  THIS IS MESSY, I KNOW.  But it works and does not break anything.

If you are happy how this works, you can call the script from cron as
well.

Note that backuploop.sh is a script which was programmed such, that it
even backs up a server in case the connection is extremely instable.
For example scylla-charybdis.ok.au. can be on a dialup line reachable
over dyndns and is disconnected and changes it's IP in more or less
regular intervalls (like once a day).  I even do it somewhat more
insane in opening an SSH port tunnel from my backup server at home to
the machine to back up.

That's it.
