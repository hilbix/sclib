2003-10-21 2.3.0:
	Version 2.3.x will be the last version track.  Perhaps there
	will be a successor sometimes with a new name.  Note that I am
	planning a public CVS where you can access even non-released
	versions.  As I do not know any way to sync two CVS
	repositories automagically, I cannot use CVS at sourceforge yet.

	New script:
	example/backuploophelper.sh

	New nonstable features:
	Scylla now also knows SSL-less mode (empty PEM-File argument).
	MD5-directory splitmode added when DIR starts with MD5/ (where
	MD5 is ignored silently).  Large files are stored under their
	MD5 sum and splited into 1 GB chunks - this needs DBM.
	example/little_poseidon.sh does not work with MD5 directories,
	so on restores you are at your own currently.

	Local file append bug (possible exploit) removed:
	The very basic logging has been moved from /tmp/scylla.log to
	/var/log/scylla.log

2003-10-02 2.2.5 (never released publicly):
	Two helper scripts added.  One as a workaround for the missing
	poseidon:
	example/backuploop.sh (which runs without problems)
	example/little_poseidon.sh (which is nearly untested)
	See the conceptual papers README.backup and README.restore on
	how to use this scripts to do a backup and restore.
	EXCEPT FOR BUGFIX RELEASES THERE WILL BE NO FURTHER
	DEVELOPEMENT OF VERSION 2.x OF S+C!

2003-05-06 2.2.4 (not announced on freshmeat):
	This version is declared stable.  Draft of some concept papers
	added.
	However it looks like this is the last version of this type of
	S&C as I am in the planning phase of version 3.0, which will
	be a complete rewrite with a major structure change.
	So do not expect Poseidon/restore capability, sorry.

2003-03-18 2.2.3:
	A little bug in Charybdis removed which broke stream mode
	on missing files.
	Put version on website.

2002-12-05 2.2.3:
	Improved Odysseus output (device)
	Improved Charybdis progress meter.
	Improved counting of throughput.
	Not available as download, as my web server crashed.
	S+C of this version still cannot handle files >=2GB.

2002-11-05 2.2.2:
	First version of Odysseus, started source redesign.
	Was available in download, but not tested and not announced.
	It was then tested and stability (odysseus, too) proved ok.

2002-07-14 2.2.1:
	Memory leakage resolved.  Esp. Charybdis ate a lot of memory.
	File streaming mode should be a lot more usable now ;)
	Wohoo, there is now a homepage!

2002-06-18 2.2:
	Charybdis reads a file list from stdin if filename = -
	This feature is highly experimental. (Fixed for 2.2.1)
	BUGfix in newname(): would never reach .~03~

2002-05-09 2.1:
	Charybdis now sets MTU.
	Scylla now refers to /etc/scylla.pem by default
	Scylla writes some diagnostics to /tmp/scylla.log
	Domain registered and documentation updated.

2001-06-18 2.0: (actually there are two versions, I count the later one)
	Scylla now needs OpenSSL and ZLIB installed.
	Charybdis does not eat (removes) files any more.
	It returns 0 if everything has been transferred successfully
	and returns 2 if the file has been transferred (success unknown).
	The throtteling code has been revised, too.

2000 1.0: Initial version without ZLIB and SSL.
	Charybdis eats away (removes) files after successful upload.
	This version was never released publicly.
