	* THERE IS ONLY ONE ChangeLog, AND IT REPRESENTS THE DEVEL BRANCH!
	IF YOU SEE THIS, YOU PROBABLY HAVE CODE FROM THE STABLE BRANCH!
	Thus some things noted in the ChangeLog cannot be found in the
	source!

	Historic entries, forgot to maintain ChangeLog, sorry:

	* Switched to a new Web Server.

	* charybdis.c (main): Timeout can now be given on the command
	line, too.
	
	* example/backuploop.sh: Improved, now acts very reliable.  Basic
	documentation is in README.backup.

	* example/backuploophelper.sh: This is a crude script to run
	additional charybdis in parallel to backuploop.sh to speed up data
	trabnsfers in LAN.  Note that S&C never were thought to be fast.
	S&C was thought to be reliable and work in a steadily failing
	surrounding.

	* sc-ssl.h: ssl_active added.  Is in preparation to non-SSL mode.

	* RATIONALE: Some information like RATIONALE added.  It explains
	in more detail why I need S&C.

	* README.backup updated to reflect current situation.

	* README.restore STILL DOCUMENTS Poseidon WHICH WILL NEVER EXIST.
	See example/little_poseidon.awk for a workaround, WHICH I DID
	NEVER TEST MYSELF YET!  (I wrote it from scatch and did not find
	the time to test it!)

2003-10-30    <tino@03.softkill.net>

	* Makefile (version.h): version.h now created from VERSION file

	* sc-include.h (VERSION): Uh, oh .. I forgot to update VERSION
	macro in sc-include.h.  No harm, as this is purely cosmetic today.
	Now VERSION is included from (new) version.h

	* charybdis.c: CVS headers.

	* example/backuploophelper.sh: I hope the last bugs now are
	removed and this should be quite stable.  Still have to go for
	some final tests of backuploop.sh as the code rewritten for bash
	currently is untested.  Scylla currently is in a state where it
	cannot be compiled and large file support for charybdis is still
	missing.

2003-10-29  root  <root@raider.03.softkill.net>

	* example/backuploop.sh: Improved.  You now need bash for it.

	* example/backuploopcommon.inc: Common parts of backuploop.sh and
	backuploophelper.sh combined into one include.  This unifies the
	calling syntax of both, too.

2003-10-22    <tino@03.softkill.net>

	* scylla.c (mkparent): If parent directory does exist not as
	directory, rename it (in case file becomes directory).
	(md5dir_open, md5dir_close, md5dir_md5send, md5dir_append)
	(md5dir_rename, md5dir_create): added
	(dofile, dofile_start): routine splitted a bit
	(dofile_start): If file is something not writeable rename it away.
	(renamenew): added

2003-10-21    <tino@03.softkill.net>

	* scylla.c (main): Features: SSL-less mode and MD5-Directory hack
	(newname): Stupid debug-logging removed
	(dofile): Some real logging (to stderr) added

2003-10-07    <tino@03.softkill.net>

	* example/little_poseidon.awk: added

2003-10-03    <tino@03.softkill.net>

	* This will become release 2.2.5 as the switch to CVS used the tag
	RELEASE_2_2_4 (which was never really released) already and I
	changed some files later ..

	* example/backuploop.sh: incorporated into source tree

	* README.backup: completed

2003-05-06  root  <root@raider.03.softkill.net>

	* README.restore: conceptual paper created

	* README (Install): Install instructions clarified

	* Makefile (CFLAGS): Added include path /usr/include/openssl for RedHat.
	

2003-03-18    <tino@03.softkill.net>

	* charybdis.c (stdinfileloop, dofile): moved some code because of
	steaming buf on unreadable/missing files.

	* Cannot remember the old changes.  Started ChangeLog here.
